The existence of a human starts with no memory or experience.


We start with the physical world or what we call physical.
⦁	The physical world is not the actual world.
⦁	The physical world is the entirety of what we refer to as physical: structures that are anchored in physicality, structural behaviors that occur in natural law, and structural properties that exist.
⦁	The physical domain (structure, structural behaviors, and structural properties) are aesthetical.
⦁	We gather data from our senses which is filtered into coherence for the phenomenal processes where what we sense is cognitively processed before consciousness.

Before the physical world, we have spatial context from the immediate senses and the temporal context from recursive cognition.
⦁	Only with experience and memory can we infer that the information that has been processed can be separated and grouped.
⦁	With this separation comes the ability to distinguish one object from another.
⦁	It is the ability to create and reinforce a referential object by differences in the multiple instances of  spatial context as temporal context.
⦁	Without temporal context, instances of spatial context have no meaning.
⦁	There is nothing to derive from the spatial context when there is no recognition.


Recognition is dependent on the reinforcement of objects into recursion.
⦁	Reinforcement itself is dependent on the difference and stability of the multiple instances of spatial context.
⦁	This reinforcement of referential structures is akin to saying "I see a structure and I will log it as a structure" which requests a minimum amount of stability from the temporal context.
⦁	Recognition temporally relates a pattern to the information derived from the output of the senses which categorizes spatial context by recognition.



notes or problems
⦁	The senses process and filter information and any information that doesn't reach the phenomenal world is considered incoherent in relation to the mind, yet in technicality, there could have been an instance where the senses have never delivered information to the phenomena before. Could all information that the world itself has to offer have the ability to be coherent to the mind?
⦁	Objects: Structure, structural behavior, and structural properties in both the physical and abstract frames and the meta-frames.
⦁	Frames: A domain created abstractly in consciousness that anchors the object by relation (physical objects in spatial dimensions, etc). Fundamental frames are physical and abstract, the rest are arbitrary domains.
