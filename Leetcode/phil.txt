1) Necessary contingencies in the substrate-as-is.
All worlds are worlds. A world that is not itself will not support phenomena. This creates a finite set of worlds that adhere to the primitives of phenomena. All possible worlds may have the contingency for impossibility in its set
All stable worlds have a significantly lower contingency for contradiction. etc etc

Substrate-adjacency to the substrate-raw-givenness
substrate-raw-givenness to substrate-representation (physical world)
"Intuitions" of time and space: primordial or learned, tabula rasa.
Phenomenal measurement: lack of objective measures.
Minimum requirements of the substrate-as-is to constitute the conditions for raw giveness to be processed into phenomality
Non-void/non-nothingness as voidness cannot ground phenomenal form and/or processes. Generativity as variation is required: the inability to differentiate between null-ness deters. Stability is required for the phenomena to not collapse.
These are the conditions for raw-giveness to form before phenomena.
Segmentation and differentiation, temporalization, spatialization, unification and recognition, etc.
Instead of only using phenomenal reduction; counterfactuals and hypothetical substrate worlds to find the minimal concepts of structure: this leads to many configurations of substrate form that need to lead to a general coherent transformational processes.

2) Substrate-as-Represented (or commonly known as the physical world).
First step: Exclude solipsism.
