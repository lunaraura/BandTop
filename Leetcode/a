Precondition of the phenomena
The phenomena is not necessary for phenomena to exist nor does the contingency of phenomena need to exist for a metaphysical world.

In a metaphysical world, the possibility of which forms, operations, and modes exist in which we phenomenally think of is infinite yet a finite number of possible worlds may only appear when we think of the phenomena that could be possible in all worlds.
There is no real common denominator for each phenomena (or supposed phenomena other than our own) that we can conclude. The phenomena includes phenomenal measurements of the appearance of our world but cannot itself be measured by objective terms or metrics.
We start with the only phenomena that we can look at: our own. One must question if there are primitive intuitions such as the intuition of space or intuition of time as we do not remember knowing these. This must then have a basis that does not have primordial intuitions but of common intuitions that we use on a relatively average basis. If the intuitions of time and space are not primitive, they are at minimum later learned as intuitions through experience. We learn to split these two concepts within quantitative terms such as the index of distance and intervals and the qualitative concepts of angle, direction, speed and continuity through language and ideas also learned through experience. 

Since the foundation of the phenomenon must come from the similarities of the average and everyday experience, we can gather that most cognition may ontologically include the form of object (its existence within our "sensory flux"), the mode and state of the object (the spatial context that comes with its existence), and the processes and operation of the object (the temporal context of its current existence). With this, it builds up what we call the phenomenal experience sin noumena. What we live in would be called the physical world or what it should be called as the representation of the metaphysical "substrate", yet this is not the substrate itself. The phenomenal experience of the substrate is only a human interface of what the substrate actually is, whether it be purely physical, ideal, coded, or in hoops of transcendental things and flux and mixes of anything or everything. The one thing that the substrate cannot be is void, null, or nothing as it should be prescribed that the phenomena must be hosted on something rather than pure nothing.
Because, in whatever way you imagine the form and operations of the substrate that (in turn) creates the phenomenal experiences, there is still the thing of form and operation that translates to our perceptions of these. In chaos and order of the substrate (which in this case refers to substrate with phenomenal relativity for measurements that we think is less or more structured) will be considered an undetermined flux that ranges from near chaotic to near stability and from minimal to variable differences of the flux. In these matters of the substrate, it will then be noted that the inference of operations of the flux will be near infinite as no particular substrate can be verifiably more real than the other without inferring that our illusion of the substrate should and does align more with the actuality of the substrate.
