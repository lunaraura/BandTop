Metaphysics 1.
(1)	Contained in the real domain, accessible to one, is the transcendental domain of phenomena. As part of the metaphysical, however the phenomena are real, the phenomena, the ideal (mental) domain, cannot study, know, and experience, the metaphysical directly.
(2)	This is not to say that any part of the metaphysical cannot be hypothesized. To hypothesize, there may be some correspondence to the basis of ideality as elemental processions and the contingencies of metaphysics to produce these events.
a.	It is better to divide each process, form, property of the ideal domain to hypothesize its transcendental correspondence.
(3)	The byproduct of the contingencies may or may not align with the sciences (logic, natural sciences, etc.) itself.
a.	Logic in its practical/use forms can be assumed to be created instead of discovered. The constraints that logic will formalize are discovered phenomenally.
b.	This is the same with mathematics. In written/linguistic forms, quantization, bases, patterns of operations are created and shared yet the foundations are discovered. These foundations that allow multiplicity, quantization, operation, and set ness to exist are discovered.
c.	Even then, the discovery is consistently empirical from the mind of individual humanity. We may bracket direction as a measurement and we will still have the foundations of direction, yet this could be fundamentally organized by the unconscious or other methods in the ideal domain or transcendentally arise from the metaphysical domain itself.
(4)	Metaphysical non-contradictions: Thingness, objects, processes, events, and others should not be included as elements to be logically compared.
a.	To posit the apple as a part of reality is already categorizing an unknown number of abstractions created by the processes of the ideal domain (a projection which already has an unknown level of correspondence) into what is real.
b.	The only thing we may hypothesize and know for certain as real is phenomena. 
(5)	Metaphysical-Ideal correspondence as the relations between the metaphysical and the ideal domain. Although unknown in its exact relations, a transcendental logic of non-contradiction of identity is at least required for phenomena to be stabilized.
“Pre-Ontology”, Phenomenology 1.
(1)	Finding the primitives of the ideal domain can be thought of as removing experience and such from each object (elements of Wittgensteinian state of affairs) into its base forms and operations, finding “commonality” in these objects and such.
a.	This may be thought of as just splitting ontology into smaller bases of ontology. The equalizer may be the commonality, flattening the object and its primitive parts into an arbitrary size and set. One can tell a wire is a wire from the continuity of the senses, shape relative to the position of the subject, etc. and the book from the same methods. An attempt to blend these two together may abstractly make a new object and even forcing recognition of this new object may enforce the subject validity, but these two may still be ontologically separated as well as separated in the natural world.
b.	Even then, the contents of the ideal domain itself is muddied with notions, signs, and recognitions of ontological abstractions.
(2)	Pre-language: In dissecting experience, we use language to describe experience. This itself is a signage from ontological creation, and empiricism. Each abstract object in an individual mind may contain a “non-sensory recognition” of the object without language (this contains an unconscious and recursively updating signage) formed by experience.
a.	Could be thought of the Husserlian retention or a memory without image.
(3)	Sensory recognition may be thought of deriving from the same mechanics as non-sensory recognition being memory.
(4)	Everything that conforms to the constraints of the ideal domain has the possibility of existing as an abstraction in the ideal. Includes constraints, substrate, of metaphysics but not the totality of the metaphysical domain itself *probably*

Correspondence of Metaphysics-Phenomenology 1.
(1)	Transcendental correspondence: spatiotemporality and the world vs the metaphysical.
(2)	Ideal domain’s primitives, metaphysical contingencies allowing ideal primitives.
(3)	Primitives of experience include structure in form, causality in procession, continuity overall.
Correspondence of Phenomenology-Ontology 1. Mind-body: transcendental correspondence of natural law and physical vs world substrate, correlation vs. unknown extra. 
Epistemology 1. 
Psychology 1. 
Sociology 1. 
Correspondence of Subject Ontology-Ontology 1. 
Ideology 1. 


Notes to the second draft.
Metaphysical Domain: synonym of the actual natural world, the totality.
Ideal Domain: synonym of totality of a lived/living life or mentality, phenomena, action, will, and the unconscious, etc.
Substrate: Non-nothingness in a domain.

Correspondence: A minimal pattern in A in which A does not necessarily affect or cause B yet the pattern in B consistently emerges in procession with A
	Coherence: A non-restriction of certain forms and processes that do not violate the domain and its law or the abstract frame and its processes.

Metaphysical-Ideal Correspondence: unknown, transcendental
Ideal-Ontological Correspondence: probably a lot
Pre Givenness-Abstract Correspondence: something about retention, memory, objectness.
Primitives: Phenomenological primitives, which hopefully transcend into what the metaphysical is not, is the basis of the ideal domain
