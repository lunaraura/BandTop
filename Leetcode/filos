Metaphysics: contingency of inherent "placeholder-Word" (articulation, causality, procession) for the ideal. contingency of ideal's raw givenness. Contingencies of what makes the phenomena exist in the first place. Some necessities may include non-nothingness, self-identification. 
Raw givenness, not extrusion of the substrate (metaphysical non-nothing) but transcendental. 

Phenomenality derives from ideal/subject and its procession, itself deriving from (transcendentally) metaphysical contingencies of etc
In arriving from raw givenness, similar configurations are recognized similarly (in human cognitions at least), similarly lighting up, if there are any temporal recognitions, signs whether they are sensory signs or abstract signs.
Signs in the physical form: transcendent of metaphysics, in each individual subject it is derived from the subject's raw givenness/picture (even somehow correlated and structured the same in each subject's configuration within the metaphysical domain) which is an extrusion caused by cognition/recognition.
Signs in the abstract form: temporality does not usually extrude as signs are solidified and broken in terms of its boundary concepts and ideas and "memorial senses" (memory of the object's specific sensed data and such)
External narration, spatial (mental) narration, temporal (memory, worldview) narration, narration of intention towards the object.

After the phenomena, external narration (raw givenness, the transcendental ideal) is turned into the cognition's spatial narration which gives agency to the mental/ideal world and influences the temporal narration of it. From where the external narration comes from, the mental/ideal world (or just the subject)  gives a narration of intention towards the object. Narration here is a placeholder for relations to story and procession instead of a word that relates to language, speaking, etc.
Excluding the sole individual and stripping Wittgenstein's metaphysics away from the picture, there is a purpose for the picture with two subjects
The coherent phenomenal (mental) world throughout any supposed iteration of itself contains primitive conditions for the phenomenal world to stably exist. 
Non-nothingness of the phenomenal world, temporality, difference, and constraint are necessary contingencies for a phenomenal world to exist and are necessary conditions for the phenomenal world to stay existent.
The next are itself primarily phenomenally categorized with referential symbols instead of negative constraints. There are basic mental preconditions, processes, and modes that allow cognition to start and flourish.
Givenness as it is after sensed (assuming that givenness before sense is transcendentally metaphysical), we recognize the given-nesses and categorize them with memory.
What is certain is the intuition of flux and qualia made by our senses and the livingness of the entirety that holds this as they are implicitly known; explicitly described in many ways as the concepts of phenomenal space and time.
CH1: The primitives of the phenomenal (mental) domain are reduced from the forms, conditions, and operations of the phenomena itself. This mental world and its totality is ontologically nothing but a process, not form, of the metaphysical substrate itself.
One metaphysical world without phenomena can be posited as anything. If our notion of phenomena is inserted into a metaphysical world, the contingencies for what the metaphysical world must provide restricts from its infinite pool. To exist, the phenomena must not operate from non-nothingness. This non-nothingness will be considered the metaphysical world's substrate and although it cannot be defined as anything, its form can be hypothesized as anything.
Here in phenomena, there is a happening-ness as it comes from its temporality and if we remove temporality from an experience, we recognize relations in each recognized difference of form. In one relation, there is itself a difference in form. Sequence in its denotation presumes ordered set, logic, etc. and to look at a set without plurality in elements would make it sequentially void. Even then, time is as much of a set as the  pre-recognition senses is. Time is non-iterable and yet in phenomena it is sequential, able to be definitively by human standards placed into an ordered set.

N1. Metaphysics, less about substrate and procession and more about the contingencies. Ontology can be a framework of categorization of these yet arrive by the transcendence of metaphysics to the ideal, described by ideal itself
Notes to the draft.
1. Metaphysical World: totality.
2. Substrate: The "non-nothingness" of the metaphysical world.
()It can be hypothesized by many people with many theories: physical, ideal, etc etc. All are for now (in this section of the note draft) equally valid theories
3. Substrate Process: The "interaction" of the substrate itself
4. In speaking of all metaphysical worlds, it does not matter what is hypothesized; in any metaphysical world where phenomena must be possible, there are restrictions to what can be hypothesized about what makes this phenomena possible.
5. It will be asserted that the phenomena cannot be actual in nothingness of the metaphysical world. It does not matter much of what the actuality of the substrate is. It must at least range from minimally part of the substrate to the entirety of it. 
6. The processes of the phenomena require minimal transcendental logic to how the metaphysical substrate's processes interact with each other whether it be any list of things that someone wants to hypothesize: The actuality of the actual, its doing, and its actualization is stable, the actual has a minimal difference, the actualization has a coherent pattern, etc.
7. To say what the substrate is cannot be said. It is actual but cannot be defined phenomenally. We posit our idea as substrate currently as a superposition of any possible world or hypothetical world that can hold phenomena

1. Phenomena in this will reference the totality of one mental world which includes the time from birth to "now" and the forms of memory, sensing, thinking, recognizing, and others such as this. (unless i find a better word)
2. Substrate immediacy is transcendentally mapped to phenomena's notion of causation (the rock is kicked in the mental image but the immediacy is different: this immediacy still must be the cause for the image and then the representation)
3. Arising from the phenomenal (or mental) primitives is recognition, processing, and mapping. Each contains a certain "substrate procession" in ideal form, in this case it would be like saying "the actualization of non-nothingness" transcending as "cognition's processes", leading to the phenomenal causality of memory.
3. We shall work backwards from big ideas, concepts, etc into the basic cognitions and hopefully even the primitive foundations of mentality itself.

questions for later inspiration and idea
1. Isn't all "knowledge" just what we sense and remember? There is no real position for the Objective difference of truth and knowledge.
2. Solipsism ruins the end goal of the draft (moral conflict of ideologies) but nice to see what would matter if it was true

old:
Hypotheses:
1. Pure reasoning of the base preconditions from Noumena to Phenomena.
2. Pure reasoning of the base preconditions from Phenomena to Noumena
-not possible without phenomenal reasoning.
-Noumena is not affirmed or negated with knowledge. It is unknown.
3. Irreducible Precondition of the Phenomena.
-Modal is-the-case or Modal Identity. Then Basic Modal Logic etc.
-Modal Identity: frames are actual only when internally stable. Frame: maximal set of mutually bound actualities. World: any actual frame. Being: totality of all eligible structures.
-Logical Space as the ground of all modal variation. Possibility for difference to occur. Actuality standing of presence. Not empirical but is the capacity for phenomena to stabilize.
-Phenomenal experience requires difference, stability, boundaries, frames. These require modal eligibility. Actuality implies base logic.
4. Modal Inference of Basic Modal Logic of Phenomena into Actual World.
-island (sensed directly),ocean (discovered knowledge), surface area (known knowledge) ratio metaphor, inference of how much ocean/island there is beyond (inference of what actual world could be beyond noumena).


1. Objects are stabilized referential structures that persist within frames. It is a referential structure that maintains internal coherence across time, memory, or space. To be an object is to persist as a coherent pattern within the frame.
2. Abstract and physical objects treated as differing only in modal anchoring: Physical objects stabilized via spatial feedback (immediate perception, senses). Abstract objects stabilized via recursive feedback (memory, experience) or logical consistency.
3. Properties are not a part of an object, but the structural constraint (the color of a leaf as structured through perception, the transitivity of a function as stabilized through recursion) by which an object remains self-coherent. It is a condition for persistence, not an entity.
4. There is no metaphysical primacy of physical over abstract. All objecthood is frame-dependent (physical as more rigid, abstract as more recursively embedded). It is a modal closure: bounded field that stabilizes a set of internally coherent properties. Both are capable of modes of failure.

1. Objects do not exist alone. They can persist through relation. Once stabilized, it is not self-sufficient. Its identity and function arise within the system of other stabilized structures. To exist at all is to stand in relation to other standing structures.
2. The relation is the structural articulation of difference, alignment, or causality across stabilized frames. They can be internal: structured predicates within an object-frame (symmetry, self-containment). They can be external: connections between objects (proximity, causation, dependency). They can also be reflexive as self-relating structures (self-reference, feedback, recursion). All these presuppose that objecthood is already stabilized.
3. The frame is a modal boundary across which the structures are coherent. A frame is not an object. It is the boundary of mutual intelligibility between objects. Within a frame: objects are measurable against each other. Properties persist across time or variation. Differences can be structured without collapse.
-A world is a frame-space populated by relational objects.
4. Not all frames are equal. They differ in Dimensional structure (how many relational axes they maintain), temporal depth (how long relations remain stable), and modal density (how much coherence is required before stabilizations break). Frames can also expand by integrating new stabilized relations, collapse when coherence thresholds are violated, and overlay with multiple interpretive or physical frames onto the same base.
5. A pseudo-world is a domain of interpretive coherence that does not satisfy the full modal criteria for world-hood. These operate as cognitive heuristics or social scaffolds, they lack ontological anchoring, its objects are not mutually stabilized, and its frames collapse under recursive stress. They behave similarly to the mental world and the physical world. They allow fast decisions in complex systems and mimic ontological behavior ("money exists", "law is binding"). These are culturally stable but structurally fragile and leak into ontological claims frequently.

Intermission:
Philosophy's Intention. The method of philosophy is a science; the explanation of philosophy is an art. One may ask what I mean by this statement which will conclude that I have already failed at philosophy. Not only can philosophy be thought of by its  process of invention and discovery but should also encompass the dialogue and critique of it as well. The origin of philosophies whether it theorizes on knowledge, reason, or any field can be traced back to a previous idea. A philosophy itself is a group of abstract ideas whether it be imposed on the material or noumenal world or whether it can be imposed on the mental or phenomenal world. Even the singular ideas are an amalgamation of abstraction where the ideas are created by its language, semantics, and interpretations.
The beginning: existence, abstract, physical. Out of these come being, ideas, and action. Alone, one may gradually begin to learn the state of the physical reality, the mental reality, and the higher cognitive reality. Starting off without knowledge is (assumably) how we start off at conception and throughout our time before birth (how much we can learn in this time is unknown). 
Interpretation: In the material world, we interact with the noumenal world through our senses that gather filtered information (due to our biological constraints) which is filtered again through our cognitive and neurophysiological constraints and constructed into meaningful information (Whether this ability to construct meaningful information is inherent or learned might still be up for debate). This gathering of data through our senses of the physical world would then be considered the interpretation of the physical reality. This interpretation would now be considered the information in which we navigate and understand the world to become a collective phenomena into our phenomenal reality.
Noumenal interpretation into material context turns into phenomenal interpretation of the material.
Context: With more than two existences comes the abstract object of relation. Between two existences or objects, relation can be thought in a certain "spatial context". With the existence of relation between time, memories, and experiences, it can be thought of as a "temporal context". Relations between objects may not be considered context itself but the relations when communicating create a context.
Language: Abstract objects has the ability to conform at a similar level of rigidity of the physical realm or by the fluidity and conceptual nature of itself. This is the case for language as a system of interpretable symbols in both audio and visual form that require and gather context
Art, by observation, can be thought up of as imposing the phenomenal interpretation of the material into the material; interpretation of the noumenal into the noumenal.

What is certain is that reality exists. Existence exists. Any noumenal and physical object can and will be.
Intermission done.

1. Interpretation is not the reception of data. It is the reconstruction of meaning atop stabilized or pseudo-stabilized frames. It overlays perceptual input with recursive structure, intention, narrative, or historical projection.
2. Interpretation arises when modal stabilization is incomplete or indeterminate, the cognitive system attempts to restore or reanchor coherence, and cultural, linguistic, or personal structures are imposed atop frames to simulate stability. The interpretation is a second-order projection. It is a reparative or directive act on frames that have drifted, collapse, or never stabilized fully.
3. Modal drift: When the relation between the object and frame loosens, interpretation fills the gap. The substitution of unstable projections to fulfill structural coherence is modal drift. Modal drift results in mythologies (where categories fuse with causality), dogma (where interpretations are mistaken for necessity), and ideology (where pseudo-worlds become socially self-reinforcing).
Interpretive Drift and the layering of historical, linguistic, or cognitive projections.
Perception reconstructs actuality through filtering.
4. Because interpretation layer over frames, they often recursively embed themselves. This leads to self-confirming belief systems, collapse of differentiation between eligible and ineligible structures, and the inflation of meaning without referential anchoring.

//think problem
A group of people sit in a room to guess how tall a person is when they walk through a very tall door every day. The group of people is large with varying levels of ability to discern how tall a person is. Each individual sitting in the room will receive tokens based on how close they are to the actual height of the person: as long as the guess is within 1 meter, they will receive more than or equal to 1 token, more within 1 centimeter, and even more within the millimeter, exponentially more within the picometer.
The survival of each person depends on expending one token a day before the day is over for enough resources to sustain themselves
Within this game are the creators of the game who may stop people from collecting tokens or spending them when they feel it is necessary. The creators may not pick or choose the people walking through the door.
No one, including the creators of the game, may leave the building until they are no longer alive but there are other rooms playing a very similar game.

In the phenomena, all things can be said to be capable of existing in the mind as representation. Whether the object, which comes from abstract or physical means, is logically and structurally sound or contradictory and false is only second-hand to merely existing in the mind in the first place.
While it is not known how the mind is in the metaphysical sense structured or what the foundations of the mind are in its physical or noumenal sense, there will be an array of structurally valid possibilities in each phenomenal world that is born according to the exact foundation that we have yet to figure out if we ever will.
Taking to account the modern version of how we conclude the mind structurally works gives us an idea of chemical and electrical patterns and with how we perceive the patterns of the individual's psychology and even group patterns in sociology will suggest a slight lean towards physicalism to the psyche. //this paragraph seems pointless here

The unfortunate case of the phenomenal world (with all of this possibility) is that the psyche cannot truly synthesize the new sensation, experience, or intuitions as a primitive object without the "external" input of senses: As almost all objects have a relation of deriving from another group of objects which may themselves derive from a combination of objects until the object cannot be broken down anymore as a simple or a primitive object (Here, we can imagine a soccer ball and create an entirely new concept called the dollar ball which we could say is a ball made entirely out of Canadian Dollars. We can imagine a circle and think about creating new shapes. We can imagine one line and create rays and curves. We can imagine a one-dimensional point, but can we imagine any other kind of geometrical primitive that is fundamental to almost all dimensions?).

"On Identity" before reading and notes.
There can be considered two types of identity as it has been stated. As Alain de Benoist says, the two types of identities that existed (in pre-modernity) was related to filiations both in the private and in the public space.
There are external pressures that shapes the identity, creating the ideals of the unshaped psyche which in turn will either push back or invite the pressure by the psyche's withering plasticity.
"Interiority was the first moral source of the modern age" and is a detrimental property to those who need control over the individual. "Knowledge is now based on the true representation of things built through reason inside the mind."
Is there truth in something meant for interpretation?
"Charles Taylor writes: 'Disengagement and he idea that the nature of things is located inside both contributed to a new concept of individual independence. The disengaged subject is an independent being, i.e., the person has to find in himself the essential reasons for being and can no longer let the greater order dictate them to him. One of the consequences of this position, in the 17th century, is the emergence of a new political atomism, conveyed in particular by Grotius, Pufendorf, Locke, and others in their theories concerning the social contract.'"
"Hobbes thinks that the quest for recognition poses a direct threat to the political power. Paradoxically, political liberalism coincides with what the theoreticians of nationalism will state after, in so far as it hands over the monopoly of the production of the forms of culture ad comprehension to the political power. The very liberal John Stuart Mill, for instance thinks that democracy cannot function in a pluralistic society, using arguments that the anti-liberal Carl Schmitt would have approved. He writes: 'Democratic power belongs to the people, but only if the people are united.' According to this view, diversity will foment suspicion and the questions of identity become irrelevant."
The filters of the psyche's duality (resistance and plasticity) should theoretically be defined first (fundamentally) by the biological makeup of the individual, second by the continuous collection of information and experience by the individual, yet in the modern age, we weigh our experiences and information about the world more than how our biological factors affect ourselves. With these two basic filters contain a layer of frameworks made as social objects: first with the biological makeup and group psychology with familiarity, in modern times with the concept of grouping by phenotype and color no matter the exact ethnicity or ancestry. Within the experience and information filter, we concoct judgements about the world that has been presented to us, creating what Baudrillard would likely call a hyperreality from the postmodern age. This lens that we concoct about the world guides the psyche's duality heavily as the individual navigates new information and experience.
Social cohesion and the social duty, although now somewhat arbitrary in a sedated society, would've been the defining factors of the individual's modus operandi in a pre-Enlightenment era.
